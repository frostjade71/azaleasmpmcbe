                        </div>
                        <p>FrostworldSMP was the very first season, created by Frost on a Minecraft Bedrock Realm. It became a nostalgic place for many loyal players who still remember it today. The realm grew with many people joining, building, and playing together.</p>

                            <h4>The McMan Bridge</h4>
                            <p>One of the most famous builds was the McMan Bridge, made by a player named McMan. It connected the spawn area to the trading hub. Many people griefed the bridge and even fought over it, but McMan never gave up. He always fixed it. When McMan left the SMP, no one heard from him again. To honor him, the players built a sculpture beside the bridge. He became a legend.</p>

                            <p>During this season, the first PvP tournament was held. GingeBiscuit135 won and became the first champion. He showed great skill and was known as one of the strongest players in the realm.</p>

                            <h4>The Fall of Frostworld</h4>
                            <p>Sadly, the season didn't end well. A mystery player used hacks to crash the realm by spamming laggy items and flooding the chat. Even though Frost tried to fix it with backups, nothing worked. The world was too broken to save. In the end, Frost decided to start a new world. Season 1 came to a close, but its memories still live on. It was the start of something great.</p>

                        <p>This season was renamed AzaleaSMP as a tribute to the addon Azalea Essentials, created by TrashyDaFox. The addon brought unique features perfect for hosting any Minecraft realm or server, making it an essential tool for smoother gameplay and better management.</p>

It was a peaceful time where the community focused on fun and collaboration. One unique trend among players during this season was the widespread practice of villager kidnapping!</p>
