                        </div>
                        <p>FrostworldSMP was the very first season, created by Frost on a Minecraft Bedrock Realm. It became a nostalgic place for many loyal players who still remember it today. The realm grew with many people joining, building, and playing together.</p>

                            <h4>The McMan Bridge</h4>
                            <p>One of the most famous builds was the McMan Bridge, made by a player named McMan. It connected the spawn area to the trading hub. Many people griefed the bridge and even fought over it, but McMan always fixes it. Since then, no one heard from him again. To honor him, the players re-design the bridge and peace has brought the players closer.</p>

                            <p>During this season, the first PvP tournament was held. GingeBiscuit135 won and became the first champion. He showed great skill and determination playing in the realm.</p>

                            <p>Sadly, the season didn't end well. A mystery player used hacks to crash the realm by spamming laggy items and flooding the chat. Even though Frost tried to fix it with backups, nothing worked. The world was too broken to save. In the end, Frost decided to start a new world. Season 1 came to a close, but its memories still lives on. Goodbye FrostWorld.</p>

                        <p>The season renamed FrostworldSMP to AzaleaSMP with the themed: Emerald  as a tribute to the addon Azalea Essentials, created by TrashyDaFox. The addon brought unique features perfect for hosting any Minecraft realm or server, making it an essential tool for smoother gameplay and better management. The spawn area stood out with its bright green emerald tiles and modern architecture</p>

It was a peaceful time where the community focused on fun and collaboration. One unique trend among players during this season was the widespread practice of villager kidnapping!</p>

                        <p>Season 3 introduced a new era—The Forgotten World. This season brought a medieval-themed world full of ruins, castles, and treasure. From the very start, some of the most active and pre-invited players joined, setting the stage for all pvp hungry players.</p>

                            <p>On July 22, 2024, Frost had to pause the server due to busy academic responsibilities. But on July 31, he made a comeback announcement—New Horizons would continue, now with a brand-new Navigation UI feature to improve gameplay.</p>
                            <p>Sadly, the server was suspended again on August 16, 2024, as Frost couldn't manage it during that time. Frost had plans for a magical, fantasy-themed Season 5 called Uncharted, but it was ultimately cancelled. With that, AzaleaSMP came to an end—closing a beloved chapter for everyone who had been part of the journey.</p>
